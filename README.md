# Node-RED Qiskit functionality
To make quantum programming more accessible, we propose a learning and interactive platform based on Node-RED, integrated with Qiskit. Node-REDâ€™s user-friendly visual interface simplifies the complexities of quantum programming by breaking down abstract concepts into manageable components. This approach bridges the gap between traditional programmers and those new to quantum computing, making the learning curve for Qiskit as intuitive as transitioning to object-oriented programming (OOP). This initiative aims to accelerate adoption and innovation in the quantum computing field.

Our goal is to abstract the core functionalities of the Qiskit library into Node-RED nodes, with each node representing a fundamental operation in quantum computing. This approach targets software developers with limited or no knowledge of quantum physics, helping them effectively utilize the Qiskit library.

To enhance learning, we have transformed the complex Qiskit documentation into easy-to-follow, graphical Node-RED flows. These flows break down content into clear, manageable steps with detailed explanations and code snippets, making quantum concepts more accessible. 
The designed nodes can be assembled into any quantum program. By interactively constructing complex quantum algorithms like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we demonstrate how our flow programming framework promotes critical thinking about the sequence and structure of quantum programs. This hands-on approach allows users to experiment with different parameters and inputs, deepening their understanding of quantum computing.
