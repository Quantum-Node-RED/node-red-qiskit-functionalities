Each instruction represents a specific quantum operation, such as a gate that changes the state of a qubit. By combining these instructions into a circuit, you create a blueprint for how qubits interact and evolve over time, ultimately allowing you to perform complex quantum computations and experiments.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# Instructions and circuits are similar in that they both describe operations on bits and qubits, but they have different purposes:\r\n- # Instructions are treated as fixed, and their methods will usually return new instructions (without mutating the original object).\r\n- # Circuits are designed to be built over many lines of code, and [QuantumCircuit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) methods often mutate the existing object.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# The rest of this flow illustrates how to manipulate quantum circuits."}
