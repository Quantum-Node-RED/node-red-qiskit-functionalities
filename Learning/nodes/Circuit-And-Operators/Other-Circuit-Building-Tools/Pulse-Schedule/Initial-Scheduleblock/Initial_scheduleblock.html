      This node provides an introduction to building quantum pulse programs using the Pulse Builder in Qiskit. A pulse program, represented as a ScheduleBlock, defines a sequence of low-level instructions that control quantum hardware at a very granular level. These pulse programs are crucial for defining the exact behavior of quantum gates, allowing precise control over quantum operations.
