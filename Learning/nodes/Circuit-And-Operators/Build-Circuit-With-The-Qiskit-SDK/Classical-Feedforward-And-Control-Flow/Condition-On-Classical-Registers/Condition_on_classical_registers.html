If the result is 01, that is, the first qubit is 1 and the second qubit is 0, then we apply an X gate to a third qubit. Finally, we measure the third qubit.

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
      This node provides an introduction to the concept of conditioning quantum operations on classical registers in a quantum circuit. Specifically, it demonstrates how to apply conditional operations based on the measurement results of multiple qubits.
