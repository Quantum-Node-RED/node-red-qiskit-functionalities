For 𝑛 qubits this change is described by a 2𝑛×2𝑛 dimensional, complex matrix 𝑈 whose adjoint equals the inverse, that is 𝑈†𝑈=1.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# Synthesizing specific unitary operations into a set of quantum gates is a fundamental task used, for example, in the design and application of quantum algorithms or in compiling quantum circuits.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# While efficient synthesis is possible for certain classes of unitaries – like those composed of Clifford gates or having a tensor product structure – most unitaries do not fall into these categories. For general unitary matrices, synthesis is a complex task with computational costs that increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Therefore, if you know an efficient decomposition for the unitary you would like to implement, it will likely be better than a general synthesis.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# **Note:** If no decomposition is available, the Qiskit SDK provides you with the tools to find one. However, note that this generally generates deep circuits that may be unsuitable to run on noisy quantum computers."}

    <p>A node that introduces the 'Synthesize Unitary Operators' tutorial.</p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
      This node provides an introduction to the 'Synthesize Unitary Operators' tutorial. It is an information node that does not require any specific input
      and does not generate any output. Instead, it is intended to be a part of a chain of tutorial nodes that explain the basics of 
      quantum computing.
