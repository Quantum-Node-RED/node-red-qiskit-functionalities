Because a qubit oscillates at its transition frequency, the controller needs to sync with its oscillation; otherwise, an unwanted Z drive is continuously applied. Usually, because the frame is matched with the drive's frequency, and drive matches with the transition's frequency, the Z drive is eliminated when the qubit frequency is calibrated properly. When you apply the <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">shift_frequency</font> instruction, it changes the drive frequency and impacts the frame. In other words, it accumulates the phase (Z) as a function of shifted frequency and duration of the program. Specifically, when you shift the frequency by <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">df</font> and spend <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">dt</font> on that frame, the qubit may experience a phase rotation of <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">df * dt</font>. The programmer needs to take this into account to control their qubits precisely.\r\n\r\n# Note also that these instructions are localized in the pulse gate in IBM devices. This means that accumulated phase and frequency shifts are not carried over. Each pulse gate always starts from the hardware default setting. This behavior is backend-dependent.\r\n" }
