      This node provides an introduction to the delay instruction used in pulse control for quantum computing. The delay instruction is a blocking command that instructs the control electronics to output no signal on a specified channel for a given duration, which is measured in terms of the backend's cycle time (dt). This feature is essential for managing the timing of pulse sequences and ensuring precise synchronization between different instructions. The node helps users understand how to use delays to adjust the timing of subsequent instructions and visualize the impact of these delays on pulse sequences.
