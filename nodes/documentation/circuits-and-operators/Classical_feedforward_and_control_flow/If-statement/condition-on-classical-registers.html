\n In the example below, we apply Hadamard gates to two qubits and measure them. If the result is 01, that is, the first qubit is 1 and the second qubit is 0, then we apply an X gate to a third qubit. Finally, we measure the third qubit. Note that for clarity, we chose to specify the state of the third classical bit, which is 0, in the if condition. In the circuit drawing, the condition is indicated by the circles on the classical bits being conditioned on. A black circle indicates conditioning on 1, while a white circle indicates conditioning on 0.`,
