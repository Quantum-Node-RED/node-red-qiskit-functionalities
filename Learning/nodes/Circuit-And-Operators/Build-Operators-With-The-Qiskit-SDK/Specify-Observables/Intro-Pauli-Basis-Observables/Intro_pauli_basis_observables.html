  <p>A node that introduces how to specify observable in the Pauli basis</p>

  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
      This node gives an introduction into how to specify observable in the Pauli Basis.
      It is an information node that does not require any specific input and 
      does not generate any output. Instead, it is intended to be a part of 
      a chain of tutorial nodes that explain the basics of quantum computing.
