This is a blocking instruction that tells the control electronics to output no signal on the given channel for the duration specified. It is useful for controlling the timing of other instructions. The duration here and elsewhere is in terms of the backend's cycle time (1 / sample rate), <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">dt</font>. It must take an integer value.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# To add a <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">delay</font> instruction, you need to pass a duration and a channel, where channel can be any kind of channel, including <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">AcquireChannel</font>. The following code uses <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">`pulse.build`</font> to begin a Pulse Builder context, and schedules the delay into the schedule 'delay_5dt'.\r\n```python\r\nwith pulse.build(backend) as delay_5dt:\r\n    pulse.delay(5, channel)\r\n    pulse.play(gaus, channel)\r\n```\r\n# Any instruction added after this delay on the same channel will execute five timesteps later than it would have without this delay.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# The image in the \"Delay Output\" node shows a comparison between the pulse with the delay applied and the original pulse." }
