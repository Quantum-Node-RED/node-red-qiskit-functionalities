    <p>A node that introduces the meaning of 'building circuit'.</p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
      This node provides an introduction to what 'build circuit' means. It is an information node that does not require any specific 
      input and does not generate any output. Instead, it is intended to be a part of a chain of tutorial nodes that explain the 
      basics of quantum computing.
