The following code uses the Pulse Builder to build a ScheduleBlock, which initialize a schedule:\r\n```python\r\nfrom qiskit import pulse\r\n \r\nwith pulse.build(name='my_example') as my_program:\r\n    # Add instructions here\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n# You can check the <font style=\"background: lightgrey\">_ScheduleBlock_</font> object you created at the \"ScheduleBlock object\" node.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# **You can see that there are no instructions yet. In the following nodes, we will show you all the instructions that can be added to a pulse.**\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# **Important:** For IBMÂ® devices, pulse programs are used as subroutines to describe gates. IBM devices do not accept full programs in this format.\r\n" }
