For general unitary matrices, synthesis is a complex task with computational costs that increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Therefore, if you know an efficient decomposition for the unitary you would like to implement, it will likely be better than a general synthesis.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n# **Note:** If no decomposition is available, the Qiskit SDK provides you with the tools to find one.
