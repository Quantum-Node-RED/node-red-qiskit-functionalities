    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>     
      This node provides an introduction to the internal representation of quantum circuits in Qiskit, specifically focusing on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) used within the transpilation stages. A DAG in Qiskit, represented by qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit objects, is composed of vertices (or "nodes") and directed edges that illustrate the flow of information between operations. This structure offers a clearer view of the circuit's operation flow compared to a simple list of gates, facilitating more effective transformation decisions. For visualizations of the DAG and further exploration, the graphviz library is recommended for generating DAG diagrams.
