      A simple node that introduce Init Stage.
    </p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>     
      This node provides an introduction to the Init Stage in quantum circuit optimization, as described in the Qiskit documentation. The Init Stage primarily handles initial optimizations in a quantum circuit, especially for circuits involving multi-qubit gates. It is essential for translating gates that operate on more than two qubits into equivalent gates that only affect one or two qubits, ensuring compatibility with most layout and routing algorithms.
