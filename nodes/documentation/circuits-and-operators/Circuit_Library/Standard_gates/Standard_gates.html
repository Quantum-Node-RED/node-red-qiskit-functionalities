  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    The <code>QuantumCircuit</code> object, referred to as <code>qc</code>, is the central structure of your quantum circuit. As you add different nodes, such as gates, to your flow, these nodes interact with <code>qc</code> to modify the circuit's composition.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, when a Hadamard gate node is added, it applies a Hadamard gate to a specified qubit in the <code>qc</code> object, transforming its state into a superposition. Similarly, adding a Multi-Controlled X (MCX) gate node uses multiple qubits as controls to flip the target qubit's state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each node appends a specific gate to the circuit, incrementally building the logic required for your quantum algorithms. These changes are made by invoking methods on the <code>qc</code> object, thus constructing your desired quantum operations.
  </p>
