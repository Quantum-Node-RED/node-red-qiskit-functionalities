    <p>A simple node that briefly introduce the features of the pulse builder.</p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
      This node provides an introduction to the the feature of pulse builder. It is an information node that does not require any specific input
      and does not generate any output. Instead, it is intended to be a part of a chain of tutorial nodes that explain the basics of 
      quantum computing.
